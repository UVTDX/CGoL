# CGoL
Life implemented in Haskell


Conway's Game of Life, often referred to simply as Life, is a Turing complete system that demonstrates emergant behaviour.  This means it can simulate any computation, such as arithmetic, logic operations, and even algorithms through behavioural patterns it generates, like gliders or oscillators.

The universe typically consists of an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which is in one of two possible states: alive or dead.
